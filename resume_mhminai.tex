\section{Research in Progress}

\cvitem{\textbf{Topic:}}{\textbf{Transformational Leadership, Affective Displays and Follower Thinking Processes.}}
\cvitem{\textbf{Details:}}{In this study we explore the interactive effects of leadership, and leader affective displays on follower thinking processes. Using a 2x2 experimental design, participants are randomly assigned to transformational or non-transformational leadership displaying either positive affect or negative affect. The participants are tasked with a divergent thinking task and a convergent thinking task. The order in which the tasks are presented is randomized. Follower persistence (motivation) and performance on the tasks are the dependent variables.}
\cvitem{\textbf{Status:}}{Presented at Doctoral Consortium. Incorporating feedback for submission to journal.}

\cvitem{\textbf{Topic:}}{\textbf{A Dynamic Dialectical Model of Individual Innovation}}
\cvitem{\textbf{Details:}}{A new model if proposed for individual innovation. It adds dynamism and a dialectical perspective. Current models of innovation do not adequately capture these aspects of innovation. We club activities required for innovation into "convergence seeking" and "divergence seeking", joined by an iterative process. This model helps to explain the inconsistent and sometimes contradictory findings in the literature of individual innovation. A computational model (system dynamics) is planned to be used for initial validation of this model.}
\cvitem{\textbf{Status:}}{Presented at Doctoral Consortium and a Conference. Incorporating feedback for submission to journal.}
\hfill   \\
\cvitem{\textbf{Topic:}}{\textbf{Leading for Innovation: A balancing act}}
\cvitem{\textbf{Details:}}{The role of leadership in innovation is explored through a dynamic dialectical perspective. A dynamic dialectical model of individual innovation that is developed as a separate research activity is sought to be further validated during this research. We theorize about the mechanisms by which leaders can have an effect on individual innovation and then validate the model by a phased multi-report cross sectional study.}
\cvitem{\textbf{Status:}}{Conceptual write-up done. Getting feedback before proceeding to data collection. Indian organizations are being invited to participate in this research study.}
